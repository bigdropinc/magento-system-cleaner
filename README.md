System Cleaner helps admin to easily clear file system and database from the old session and report files.

In order to begin cleaning, you need to configure Cron for your project. We also suggest you to install [AOE Scheduler](https://github.com/AOEpeople/Aoe_Scheduler) for Magento 1.

Extension also gives admin the opportunity to view files in the log and report directories via file manager tool.
After the module installation, follow the path: _System -> Tools -> File Manager_. There you will be able to browse directories that were mentioned above.

### Feature list
